# Creating A Rails Form

This project is about creating a form in pure HTML and reform it by using form_tag helper and form_with helper in Rails.

The form created in this projects includes 3 input fields username, email, password, and 1 submit button. This form allows you to create new instances and save them in a table in the database. It also enables you to edit the information of users in the table.

The form raises an error when a field is empty and when certain validation is not met.
